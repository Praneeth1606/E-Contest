				NEVER DENY ANYTHING IF FREE!

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
American Express also gives an option of getting supplementary cards for free with the purchase of each credit card.					

For example for an American Express Platinum Card one can get 4 supplementary cards for free. 
There are totally ‘b’ uniques types of credit cards marketed by Amex. 
Now your task is to find the total number of supplementary cards that can be obtained for free, 
given that you purchase 'a' credit cards with each of them allowing ‘c’ supplementary cards for free.

SAMPLE TEST CASE 1 :

INPUT:
666

OUTPUT:
36

EXPLANATION :
a = 6, b = 6, c = 6.
6 * 6 = 36 (Don't ask me which ones to multiply!)


SAMPLE TEST CASE 2 :

INPUT:
222

OUTPUT:
4

EXPLANATION :
a = 2 , b = 2, c = 2. 
2 * 2 = 4. Hence output is 4. (Mind it, not 04 or <space>4 or 4<space>)

TIME ALLOWED : 5sec

MEMORY LIMIT : Maximum 10^5 commands are only allowed.

NOTE : 
Print the string representing the answer not the character with answer as it's ASCII value.
So, if the answer is 36 print '36' (without the quotes and without spaces) and not the character with ASCII value 36.
